<h1>The Movies According To Swetha</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time. </h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Sita Ramam</h3>
<p>Because of its gentleness and royalty of love for their loved ones.</p>

<h3>Oo Kadhal Kanmani</h3>
<p>I love DQ's classy loving side and Manirathnam's way of love definition.</p>

<h3>Shershah</h3>
<p>The action and patriosism they have shown in the movie was extraordinary.The speacial part is raatan lambayan song.</p>
